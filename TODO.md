## Picking Examples/Challenges
Try looking through Snort alerts & CVEs and try to replicate them.  
Try copying other challenges, or just explain how to setup other events/challenges, and provide write-ups.  

## Working on new stuff
Open a new branch per goal, name 'dev-<cve-### OR snort-rule, etc>'.  
When ready, create a pull request to merge the branch & delete it.
